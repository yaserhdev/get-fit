## Description
GET Fit is our final group project for the edX and George Washington University Full Stack Bootcamp. The application was built to allow users who are serious about or interested in keeping track of their workouts to do just that, once they create a secure account. 

The application allows users to add a day & date, add individual exercises grouped by body part (legs, chest, arms, etc.) as well as the associated number of repitions and sets that they perform with each exercise. Once the user has finished their workout, they can save the exercises to their account for that specific day & date. 

## User Story
